Problem #24 Lexicographic permutations

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.
For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it
lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012 021 102 120 201 210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
