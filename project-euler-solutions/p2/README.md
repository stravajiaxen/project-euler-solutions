# Euler 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

## Description
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

*4613732*

The method for problem 1 won't work quite as well for problem 2. While you could just
iterate through numbers from 1 to 4 million and check if each is a fibonacci number, that's too
long to do.

I start by storing a list of fibonnacci numbers from a seed of a couple numbers (1, 1, 2).
It's easiest to just check the max of the list of fibonacci numbers to verify that it's
not over 4,000,000.

This time, we don't want the sum of all the list, just the numbers that are divisible by 2 (even numbers).
I just use a simple loop to check and keep a running total like problem 1.

Fun aside, I think the problem asked for only the sum of the even-valued terms
to remove the ambiguity that some say the first fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and others say just 1, 2, 3, 5 (i.e. is
1 counted twice? It doesn't matter if we don't count the odd numbers!)
