# Euler 12: Highly divisible triangular number

## Description
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Solution

7 Seconds in python to run :/

This one was interesting. I used a generator to make some triangle numbers.

It was fairly trivial afterwards, though. I remembered from earlier that I can just go to the square root
rather than all the way through all the numbers so I did that this time. It probably would have
taken much longer if I hadn't remembered that :D
