Solutions to problems from projecteuler.net

## Structure

The project-euler-solutions directory contains programs (sometimes with writeups) with answers to the problems
from projecteuler.net.

## A note about code quality

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a series of math challenges written with the intention
that a computer would need to be used to solve them. Their nature is such that
each problem should take < 100 lines of code to complete. The problems are often
pretty ugly and require a bunch of if statements. The goal of each is to complete the task.

This code might not be the best quality. I wrote it to get an answer.
Sometimes the method is by brute-force. Sometimes there will be commented-out code.
There may be lacking docstrings. I may sometimes intentionally
 choose to do things the "hard" way even when the perfect module
 exists for the problem...

Ultimately, I do not expect this to be "production-ready". It's just my chicken scratch
